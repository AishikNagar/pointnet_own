# Own implementation of PointNet
Under development! Expecting completion around 4/19/2019.

This project is a personal implementation of the object classification portion of [PointNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) and is implemented in Keras with a TensorFlow backend.

## Setup
Used PCL. If don't have it and are using a Mac, recommend installing via Homebrew.
