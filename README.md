# Own implementation of PointNet
Under development! Expecting completion around 12/2019.

This project is a personal implementation of the object classification portion of [PointNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) and is implemented in TensorFlow 2.0.

## Setup
Used PCL. If you don't have it and are using a Mac, I recommend installing via Homebrew.

## Dataset

  <p>Fig. 1: Given two input frames, the images represented <br/>by (c) and (d) are passed as inputs to the CNN.</p>
